# Split multi-sample VCF by file
This repository holds a .sh script for splitting a multi-sample VCF file by sample ID, keeping all the remaining features and data of the SNP and creating a VCF file for each sample. It also contains a .py file that cleans the VCF file of possible format mistakes (e.g. unallowed characters).
